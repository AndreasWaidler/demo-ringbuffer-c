# Ring Buffer Demo

This application demonstrates how to solve the producer/consumer problem
in C using a ring buffer on a POSIX system. The application prints the
contents of the ring buffer to the console as well as the states of both
producer and consumer (creating/consuming the next element or waiting
for the next free slot).
